# Node
Its a simple Node project that will notify with playing music when it found an availablity of slot for following condition
1. age = 18-45
2. availibility for the pin provided in .ini file

Steps to run
1. fork the project & clone
2. cd to the directory
3. npm i
4. node app.js

Enhancements:
I have tried to implement mail using nodemailer but it somehow not working for me.
Anyone wish to add the feature is really appreciated.
